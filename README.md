# LearnX

LearnX is a community-driven platform where anyone can learn anything in simple, structured steps. Users pick a topic (any category) or create their own, and AI automatically generates a complete learning track with modules, lessons, and small actionable tasks.

## Problem

Learning on the internet is scattered.
YouTube video series, blogs, courses, docs — everything is everywhere. Most people struggle because they don’t get a clear step-by-step path to follow. They waste time deciding *what to learn next*.

## Solution

LearnX converts any topic into a structured learning journey.
Just type the topic → AI generates lessons → users follow each step and track progress. This removes confusion and makes learning simpler, cleaner, and faster.
